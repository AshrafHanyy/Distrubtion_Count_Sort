\textbf{Time Complexity:} Counting Sort has a linear time complexity of $O(n + k)$. It excels when the range of input values $(k)$ is not significantly larger than the number of elements $(n)$. Counting Sort outperforms comparison-based sorting algorithms, such as quicksort or mergesort, when dealing with small value ranges.\textbf{Space Complexity:} Counting Sort uses additional space for the count array, sized $O(k)$. The space complexity becomes a concern when the range of values is large, despite the linear time complexity.
