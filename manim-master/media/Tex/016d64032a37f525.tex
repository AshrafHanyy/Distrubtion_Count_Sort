For our example, the last element in the array is 12, and, since its distribution value is 4, we place this 12 in position $4 - 1 = 3$ of the array $S$ that will hold the sorted list. Then we decrease the 12â€™s distribution value by 1 and proceed to the next (from the right) element in the given array.
