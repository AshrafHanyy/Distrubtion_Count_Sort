It is more convenient to process the input array right to left. For our example, the last element is 12, and, since its distribution value is 4, we place this 12 in position $4 - 1 = 3$ of the array $S$ that will hold the sorted list. Then we decrease the 12â€™s distribution value by 1 and proceed to the next (from the right) element in the given array.
